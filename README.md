# ðŸš— Urban Parking Analytics System

A Streamlit-based interactive dashboard that visualizes parking availability and optimizes urban parking management using real-time or simulated data.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

The Urban Parking Analytics System aims to address parking congestion in city areas by providing users and city officials with a visual and data-driven platform to monitor parking occupancy, traffic conditions, and queue lengths across multiple locations.

This solution helps:
- Users locate available parking spaces.
- Authorities analyze traffic flow and parking demand.
- Reduce overall congestion and waiting times.

**Explanation**
ðŸ“Œ Explanation
This architecture outlines the end-to-end flow of the Urban Parking Analytics System:

Parking Data Source:

The system begins with structured parking data, usually in the form of a CSV file or an external API.

The data contains attributes like SystemCodeNumber, Occupancy, VehicleType, QueueLength, Traffic Conditions, etc.

Pandas Data Processing:

Using pandas, the raw data is read, cleaned, and processed.

Filtering, grouping, and transformation are performed to prepare it for visualization and analysis.

Analytical Computation:

Computed insights include metrics like average occupancy, queue lengths, peak hours, and congestion levels.

This layer ensures the data is insightful and usable for visualization.

Streamlit Frontend:

This is the interface layer, where users interact with the app.

Streamlit enables fast rendering of UI components like maps, graphs, and filter options with minimal code.

Folium Map Display:

Parking locations are shown geographically using Folium.

Markers, color coding, and tooltips indicate occupancy and traffic conditions visually.

Plotly Graphs & Metrics:

Interactive charts (bar, pie, line) are generated using Plotly.

These help users understand trends such as vehicle-type distribution or parking load over time.

User Input Filters:

Dropdowns and sliders allow users to filter the data by location, vehicle type, or specific conditions.

This makes the dashboard more dynamic and customizable based on user needs.
